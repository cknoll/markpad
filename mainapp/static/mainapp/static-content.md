# About markpad

markpad is a simple web application to display the content of etherpads interpreted as [markdown source](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). It thus allows to combine the power of etherpads (author-colors, simple installation, variety of plugins, ...) with the aesthetics of markdown rendering.


markpad is free software and hosted on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/cknoll/markpad) and [github](https://github.com/cknoll/markpad).
